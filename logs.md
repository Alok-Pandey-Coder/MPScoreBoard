## 2026-10-31 — Affidavit Block Merged & Validation Rules Extended

- **Summary:** Integrated ADR/MyNeta election affidavit data from `data/reference_packs/officials_enriched_pack/data/mp_affidavit_enrichment.csv` into `data/processed/mps.json` via updated `scripts/06_merge.py`; updated `scripts/07_validate.py` with affidavit validation rules; updated `data.md` registry.
- **Files or areas changed:**
  - `scripts/06_merge.py` (added affidavit loader, custom enrichment loader, and source provenance).
  - `scripts/07_validate.py` (added validation for reported affidavits: non-negative assets/cases/liabilities and 2024 election year).

  - `data/processed/validation_report.md` (block status updated: `affidavit: reported: 7`).
  - `data/processed/snapshot.json` (regenerated snapshot with updated SHA-256).
  - `data.md` (registry updated to show affidavit status 100% complete).

- **Validation performed:**
